I have made these changes to my portfolio website:

1. Add homepage link to logo
2. Change all alt-text to meaningful name without abbreviation
3. Make send-button look better with background color
4. Substitute texts with icons for github, linkedin, portfolio, and also add hover decoration
5. Add hover affect to all project pictures which make it bigger when hovering
6. Add animation and transforming for all <h2> which is title of each page

I am using Google analytics as a 3rd party JavaScript to collects data from my websites to create inside reports. The detail of setting up and using it:

1. Create Google Analytics account with account name and property setup
2. Add URL and name stream, and end up having stream URL, Measurement ID, Stream Name, Stream ID
3. Get global site tag from tagging instruction and add it to <head>
4. Publish code to Netlify
5. Get back to Google Analytics, from report and real time, we can see reported data
